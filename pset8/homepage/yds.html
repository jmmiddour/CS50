                I have been a stay at home mom since Jan 2008. I am luck enough to have a wonderful husband of almost 20 years who has made it posible for me to stay home with our 2 boys. Now that my youngest is almost a teenage, I felt the need to get back in the job field again.

                I live in a very rural area in North Central Florida and there is not a whole lot of work in this area that would pay me enough to pay all of the bills so that my husband can follow his dream of being a welder. After everything that my husband has sacrificed, I want to be able to return the favor by making enough money that he can go to school to become a welder.

                I have always had a thirst for knowledge. I have self-taught myself for a long time now. I am a high school graduate who was not able to attend college after high school due to financial reasons. The thought of going back to college at my age frightened me. However, I needed to find a way to start a new career in something that I will love doing.

                One day, while I was browsing the internet for online schools, I happened upon an ad for Lambda School. The first thing that appealed to me about Lambda was that they offer an ISA (Income Share Agreement) which means you do not pay them anything until you have a job making at least $50,000 a year. This was the only way that I could see being able to afford to go through schooling for the knowledge to get myself into a new career field.

                Lambda offers several tracks in the tech field. I researched the different tracks that they offer and found that the Data Science track would be the best fit for me. Even though I only made it through to algebra in high school, I have always enjoyed math and working with numbers. I also love puzzles and challenges. I even toyed with the idea of getting into the forensics side of crime scene investigations. So I felt that Data Science would be the perfect fit for me.
            </p>
            <p class="rcolumn">
                After starting Lambda, I have found myself really enjoying attending Lambda for Data Science. I started my studies not knowing much about the field as far as implementation. The only coding experience I had prior to this was, I played with a little HTML by self-teaching myself when I was younger. I have created my own websites for online businesses I have attempted before but most were created using tools available from other websites online.

                I have never study CSS or JavaScript before due to not having a need for it. I have been in several office-type positions in my past. However, I have not worked with SQL before either. I did most everything in Excel and Word. I found the office jobs that I enjoyed the most were the ones that involved working with numbers and data collection and analyzing the data.
