                <p>As I mentioned on my homepage, I am currently a student attending both Harvard and Lambda School. I am also a stay at home mom and have been now for 12 years. I decided it was time to get back in the work field again since my youngest is almost a teenager already.
                <br>
                <p>My wonderful husband, of almost 20 years, has done whatever he needed to, to make sure that I could have the privilege of staying home with our 2 boys, even when he knew it was going to take him away from us for most of the year, just to make sure the bills got paid. Now it is my turn to get a job making enough money to pay all our bills so my husband can finally follow his dream of going to welding school and becoming a welder.</p>

                <p>At Harvard, I am enrolled in the CS50x 2020 program. I started the course online in October 2020, however life prevented me from being able to stay on top of it like I wanted to. It is really rough trying to attend 2 schools at one time and still tend to my regular household duties. I am really enjoying this program and I have learned a lot. I never, in my wildest dreams, ever thought that I would be attending any program at Harvard, but thanks to the advent of a lot of courses being remote now, I have been offered the opportunity and I am so grateful that I did. Since I have started the CS50 course, I have shared my delight in the program with anyone that will listen to me. I just can not brag enough on this program. I will say that it is not for the faint of heart though, these problem sets can be really challenging, but that is part of what I love so much about the program.

                <p>At Lambda School, I am currently enrolled in Data Science. When I started the program I really liked it and felt that I was getting my money's worth. However, not so much recently due to a lot of changes that the school recently made to the structure of the program. They have been asking for the feedback though and I have shared my disappointments and concerns with them, along with a lot of other students. I really feel that Lambda can be a great school again but it is going to take a lot of refactoring to get them back to where they were in my book. They are talking about some changes that will be rolling out in Jan and Feb 2020 to fix the broken parts. Time will tell though and I am willing to stick it out a little longer to see if they really do what they say they are going to do.
