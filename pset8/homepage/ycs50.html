                I was and still am attending Lambda School when I first heard about CS50 in one of the slack channels within Lambda. Being that I have heard this was a great course to take in order to prepare for the CS portion of the Lambda Data Science course, I decided to check it out. This was prior to finding out about the recent changes that Lambda has implemented.

                I am not in the Lambda CS unit yet, however, I have heard that the CS unit is not what it used to be. Lambda still requires you to pass the GCA with a 650+ before you can proceed onto labs. I have heard that they do not truly prepare you for the GCA with the new CS program. They did say that they will be changing some things in Jan and Feb 2021, but I do not think they will be making any changes to the new CS unit.

                When I started this course, I was just getting comfortable using Python, thanks to Lambda School, and had no knowledge whatsoever of C but after starting to watch the lectures for CS50, I felt like I was in a learning environment where I would actually be able to understand the concepts as I needed to. They have some wonderful instructors who teach this program and I really feel that if it was not for them, this course would be so much harder. I have an extreme appreciation for David Malan, Brian Yu, and Doug Lloyd who have made learning this material easy enough to understand without the need of a lot of extra research time.

                First, there is David Malan who does the main lectures. Without his high energy and passion for teaching this material, I do not feel that I would be as far in the course as I am. He makes learning fun and exciting. He uses "real world" examples to explain the concepts in more layman's terms to make it easier for everyone to learn, no matter what your prior experience is. I am a visual learner so this is the ideal course for me.

              Brian Yu and Doug Lloyd are also great instructors. They go into detail in the supplemental videos that help you to better understand the concepts after David has introduced you to them. The walkthroughs that they do are great too. If you pay real close attention to them, they drop hints as to what will be the best code for doing certain tasks. This is very helpful for me because they don't just give you the answers but they help you to start on the right track and what direction you should go.

              I am very grateful that I have been offered this opportunity. If this course was not available online then I would not be able to take it and I would have missed out on an excellent course and wonderful instructors.
