1. Open the memory card file
  - Use `FILE *f = fopen(filename, "r");` to open/read the file
  
2. Look thru the memory card file for the beginning of a JPEG
  - Every JPEG always starts with `0xff 0xd8 0xff` (1st 3 bytes)
  - Last byte of every JPEG is `0xe<*>` <*> = can be from 0-f
  - Each JPEG is stored back to back in the memory card file
    For each 512 block in memory card file
      if block starts with `0xff 0xd8 0xff` and 4th byte == `0xe*`
      (f[0] == 0xff & f[1] == 0xd8 & f[2] == 0xff)
      (use bitwise: (f[3] & 0xf0) == 0xe0)
        3. Open a new JPEG file
           `fread(data, size, number, inptr)`
           - data: pointer to data storage block
           - size: number of bytes you want to read from file
           - number: number of elements you want to read
           - inptr: FILE * you are going to read data from
        4. Keep writing data in 512 bytes until a new JPEG is found
           - each new JPEG should be named ***.jpg starting with 000.jpg
             (sprintf(filename, "%03i.jpg", 2);)
             - filename: name of the string you want to write to
             - "%03i.jpg": format (3 digit integer.jpg)
             - 2: the number that you want to substitute in the 3 digit int
             - make sure that filename has enough chars to represent filename
        5. Close the JPEG and start writing a new JPEG
           - `FILE *img = fopen(filename, "w");`
             (write a new file with all the memory you find for that JPEG in the memory file)
           - `fwrite(data, size, number, outptr);`
             - data: pointer to bytes that will be writen to file
             - size: how big the elements are (# of bytes in each element you are going to write)
             - number: number of elements you are going to write
             - outptr: FILE * pointer you are going to write the data to
        6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the end of the file is reached
           - need to make sure you have a condition in the `fread` method above to tell the program when it has reached the end of the file.
    return [new JPEG file]

------------------------------------------------------

Open memory card file

Repeat until the end of the card:
    
    Read 512 bytes into a buffer (using `fread`)
    
    If the start of a new JPEG:
        If the first JPEG:
            start writing first file
            
        Else:
            close file
            start writing a new JPEG file
            
    Else:
        If already found a JPEG:
            keep writing to the JPEG file
            
Close any remaining files
