SEBASTIAN
Of
course
under
his
breath
as
he
heads
to
the
piano
Though
don't
think
they
care
what
play
BOSS
do
and
don't
want
to
hear
the
free
jazz
SEBASTIAN
How
bout
one

one
for
me
Or

the

just
glares
Or
all
for

Good

Well
Welcome
back
SEBASTIAN
There's

With

Jingle

INT
RESTAURANT
LATER
The
restaurant's
demographic
has
changed
now
younger
stragglers
wandering
in
Sebastian
looks
beyond
bored
He
finishes
Wish
Merry
Christmas
Zero
applause
He
begins
new
chart
Deck
the
Halls
But
something
seems
to
come
over
him
now
He's
restless
Slowly
his
playing
drifts
off
his
fingers
charting
their
own
path
And
then
hear
melody
The
one
Mia
heard
outside
The
one
refer
to
from
now
on
as
Mia
and
Sebastian's
song
The
door
opens
and
Mia
steps
in
She
sees
Sebastian
at
the
piano
Is
instantly
struck
by
his
playing
MIA
AND
SEBASTIAN'S
THEME
Gradually
all
sounds
but
the
music
drop
out
drift
away
from
reality
Even
the
walls
seem
to
go
slightly
darker
as
though
Sebastian
and
Mia
were
all
alone
He
concludes
his
piece
with
jumble
of
chords
his
playing
almost
free
jazz
now
as
pull
back
to
real
life
and
see
the
Boss
looking
on
in
scorn
Revision
Sebastian
finishes
Silence
Mia
looks
like
the
wind
has
been
knocked
out
of
her
Sebastian
looks
for
second
and
sees
her
They
look
at
one
another
Just
moment
Then
the
Boss
taps
Sebastian
on
the
shoulder
STAY
ON
Mia
as
she
watches
Sebastian
rise
with
the
Boss
just
see
the
Boss
talking
to
Sebastian
can't
hear
what
is
said
Then
get
closer
and
realize
BOSS
every
goddamned
night
Sebastian
is
silent
Then
doesn't
want
to
have
to
beg
but
SEBASTIAN
I'll
stick
to
the

promise
BOSS
Too
late
done
SEBASTIAN
not
gonna
find
better

that
BOSS
leans
in
and
Do

here
gives
shit
With
that
the
Boss
walks
off
linger
on
Sebastian
Anger
giving
way
to
hurt
He
starts
hurrying
toward
the
door
BACK
TO
Mia
who
didn't
hear
what
was
said
She
watches
Sebastian
takes
breath
so
moved
that
she's
about
to
lay
it
all
out
swoops
in
to
corner
him
and
MIA
just
wanted
to
say
saw
playing
and
but
Sebastian
just
walks
right
by
his
shoulder
bumping
against
Mia's
for
an
added
measure
of
disdain
He
heads
out
the
door
Slams
it
shut
Mia
is
left
standing
on
her
own
She
looks
like
she's

Eh
They

SEBASTIAN
Not

Agreed

And
on
that
they
SING
LOVELY
NIGHT
Mia
and
Sebastian
try
to
downplay
the
romanticism
of
this
setting
this
moment
being
lost
here
at
night
alone
together
atop
hill
the
city
glittering
before
them
no
big
deal
nothing
they
haven't
seen
or
felt
before
because
after
all
there's
no
chance
for
romance
between
them
Of

swelling

building

otherwise
Mia
tires

finds

fishes

moves

She
moves

Still
suspicious
He
moves

She
moves

They
seem
to
be
moving
in

their
even
wanting

And
bit

before
our
eyes
they've
almost
slipped
into

rises
Mia
rises
as
well
The
two
look
at
each
other
Run
back
to
the

hop
atop

the

stretch
out
like
magic
carpet
They
share

share
look
jump
off
AND
START
REALLY
DANCING
NOW
Mia
does
move
Sebastian
responds
Sebastian
does

Mia
shakes
her
Nope
They
make
the
road
their
own
growing
more
and
more
energized
as
surprised
as
are
to
find
that
they
can
really
dance
together
Just
as
this
starts
to
look
like
blossoming
romance
real
joy
peeking
through
our
two
heroes
getting
closer
and
closer
and
closer

and
see
the
following
moments
in
brief
vivid
GLIMPSES
as
move
in
closer
on
the
imagery
The
first
home
Mia's
pregnancy
The
newborn
child
The
child's
first
birthday
The
child's
first
day
of
pre
school
all
dressed
Everything
here
glows
with
the
warmth
of
old
home
movies
These
are
memories
fluttering
by
grabbed
at
random
and
yet
all
concocted
dreamed
out
of
nothing
The
SCORE
continuing
to
sway
and
taking
right
to
Sebastian
and
Mia
husband
and
wife
father
and
mother
hiring
babysitter
because
they've
decided
to
go
out
for
night
at
the
movies
back
to
now
The
look
here
is
unaffected
just
everyday
The
MUSIC
quiets
slightly
everything
goes
more
natural
as
this
happily
married
couple
hit
the
road
then
find
themselves
blocked
by
traffic
jam
then
take
side
route
winding
in
another
part
of
L
then
walk
down
the
street
then
hear
music
jazz
combo
playing
somewhere
and
step
into
place
that
looks
just
like
Sebastian's
club
They
sit
down
to
listen
And
then
and
this
is
how
our
imagined
montage
musical
number
ends
the
combo's
PIANIST
who
of
course
is
not
Sebastian
launches
into
Mia
and
Sebastian's
melody
and
Mia
and
Sebastian
look
at
each
other
recognizing
it
The
music
goes
full
circle
back
to
where
it
started
as
Mia
and
Sebastian
look
into
each
other's
eyes
lean
in
and
softly
but
with
all
the
love
in
the
world
KISS
Revision
CUT
BACK
TO
THE
PIANO
Sebastian
has
just
finished
his
piece
back
to
reality
The
audience
in
the
club
applauds
Beat
Mia
looks
at
Sebastian
Looks
away
moment
passes
DAVID
Do
want
to
stay
for
another
She's
silent
for
second
Then
she
looks
at
David
MIA
No
should
go
He
nods
They
rise
from
their
seats
and
for
the
exit
Just
as
they
reach
the
door
and
as
David
steps
out
Mia
turns
and
looks
back
at
Sebastian
He
looks
at
her
Their
eyes
lock
hint
of
tear
in
both
And
ever
so
subtly
for
just
fleeting
second
Mia
smiles
the
kind
of
smile
could
miss
blinked
but
enough
to
signal
to
Sebastian
that
she
recognized
the
melody
he
played
and
that
she
still
remembers
it
and
still
thinks
of
it
to
this
day
Then
she
walks
out
the
door
Sebastian
glances
at
his
fellow
musicians
Then
he
nods
and
they
launch
into
new
chart
EXT
STREET
NIGHT
silent
outside
can't
hear
the
music
Mia
and
David
reach
their
car
They
get
in
It
pulls
out
Passing
by
Sebastian's
club
the
car
continues
on
stay
put
the
jazz
club
on
one
side
of
the
frame
the
lights
of
the
car
on
the
other
Those
lights
growing
smaller
and
smaller
before
finally
disappearing
into
the
big
L
night
IRIS
FADE
OUT
THE
END
