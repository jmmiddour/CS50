DNA Pseudocode
---------------
Need 2 command line agruements:
1. CSV file - STR counts for a list of individuals
2. TXT file - The DNA sequence to identify

Print an error message of my choice for incorrect number of arguements

Open the CSV and read into memory
    First row should be column names
    First column will be Name and following will be STR sequences
    
Open the TXT and read into memory

For each STR in the TXT file
    Compute the lonest run of consecutive repeats
    
    If the STR counts match exactly to an individual in the CSV
        Print name of matching individual
        
    Else
        print "No match"
